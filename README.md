## Outline - An OpenBoard

Outline is my take on the OpenBoard. A real-time application made using:

- HTML, CSS, Js
- Canvas API (for 2D drawing)
- Socket.io, Express server (for real-time drawing)
- Deployed using Heroku with Github

We can -

✍.  Draw

❌.   Erase

🗒.  Note (text)

⬇️.   Download the OpenBoard

⬆️.   Upload an image/document

↪️.   Undo

↩️.   Redo









## Deployment

To deploy this project run

```bash
  npm run deploy
```
